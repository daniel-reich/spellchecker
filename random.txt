where at a young age, he held senior positions in the developing tramway
systems of Detroit and New Jersey. In 1898, he served in the United States
Navy during the short Spanishâ€“American War.

In 1907, his management skills led to his recruitment by the UERL, which was
struggling through a financial crisis that threatened its existence. He quickly
integrated the company's management and used advertising and public relations to
improve profits. As managing director of the UERL from 1910, he led the takeover
